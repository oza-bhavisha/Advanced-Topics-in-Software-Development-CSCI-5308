# Assignment 2 â€“ S.O.L.I.D. Principles of Object-Oriented Programming

## **Overview** ##
1. Designed and programmed classes that violate a S.O.L.I.D. principle.
2. Designed and programmed the same classes that correct the S.O.L.I.D. violation.
3. Following things can be found in the pdf named B00935827_Assignment 2:
   - Description of the classes and code (Good and Bad)
   - Explanation on Why the code violates the principle?
   - Explanation on How are the violations fixed?

## **Checklist** ##
- [x] Package created as asked in the Assignment
- [x] Under each bad package, you have 5 sub-packages(d,I,l,o,s)
- [x] Created 4 different programs for 5 principles
- [x] Tried to accommodate the fundamental object-oriented programming concepts
- [x] Under good package, designed classes that fix each of the S.O.L.I.D. principles violated by bad classes 
- [x] 150 lines of code for each sub package in good and bad package
- [x] Each of sub package under bad and good have a main method to run
- [x] README file included
- [x] PDF created and uploaded, which explains the Good and Bad packages how they are violated and how they got fixed
- [x] Followed the Git Commit, Push, Pull flow in timely manner

## **Instructions** ##

1. For **Single Responsibility** and **Open/Close Principles**, good and bad code's Main method will directly print the results and won't ask user input.
2. For **Liskov Substitution**, **Interface Segregation** and **Dependency Inversion**, it will ask for a user input for the given list
   - If the valid input is selected, it will ask further points related to that choice. Else it will show the message like "Invalid choice selected"
